Apache Airflow provides a simple way to write, schedule, and monitor workflows using pure Python. In this blog post, we’ll cover Apache Airflow core concepts and components and then build and operate a simple data pipeline.

## Why Apache Airflow is ideal for data pipelines

Apache Airflow was started by Airbnb in 2014 as a solution to manage complex data workflows. It has been open source since the first commit and was announced as a top-level project by Apache in 2019. Apache Airflow has a number of benefits that make it easier to manage the complexity of managing batch scheduled jobs, including:

- **Scalable**: the architecture uses a message queue system to run an arbitrary number of workers.
- **Dynamic**: pipelines are written in Python, allowing dynamic generation.
- **Extensible**: it’s easy to integrate customer operators and libraries.
